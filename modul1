What is Python?
Python is a programming language that has gained popularity over the past few years. It is an interpreted high-level programming language.

It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and released as open-source software in 2000, with major releases every three years since then.

In recent years, Python has become one of the most popular data analysis and statistics languages, primarily due to its simplicity and flexibility.
